# OSI Model
## Def
```
The OSI model, or Open Systems Interconnection model, is a framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven distinct layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application. This model helps different systems communicate effectively by providing a structured approach to networking.

- Presentation(Syntax, Security) (Sofware)

- Session(API, Socket)(Sofware)

- Transport(TCP/UCP)(Sofware)

- Network(Packets)(Hardware)

- Data Link(Ethernet)(Hardware)

- Physical(Router, cable)(Hardware)
